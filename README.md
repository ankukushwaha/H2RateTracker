# H2RateTracker
"H2RateTracker is a dynamic web application developed as part of my college final year project. It is designed to track and optimize the production rate of hydrogen (H2) based on variables such as irradiance, area, and time. By inputting these values, users can observe real-time changes in power, energy, and ultimately, the H2 production rate.
