# H2RateTracker
"H2RateTracker is a dynamic web application developed as part of my college final year project. It is designed to track and optimize the production rate of hydrogen (H2) based on variables such as irradiance, area, and time. By inputting these values, users can observe real-time changes in power, energy, and ultimately, the H2 production rate.
This project showcases my proficiency in web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on React for building a responsive and interactive user interface. It also demonstrates my understanding of data manipulation and calculation algorithms.

Key features of H2RateTracker include:

Real-time calculation of power, energy, and H2 production rate based on user-defined parameters.
Dynamic updating of results when variables are adjusted.
User-friendly interface for easy input and output management.
By developing H2RateTracker, I have gained valuable experience in front-end development, data visualization, and problem-solving. I am proud of this project's contribution to the field of renewable energy and its potential for optimizing H2 production processes.
